# What is Bamazon?
Bamazon is a CLI (command line interface) that selects data from a virtual inventory hosted in MySQL. By selecting the desired amount of a desired object, bamazon outputs a successful order update including the order's total cost. If the desired amount exceeds the stock inventory, bamazon alerts the user that the order cannot be placed. Like a real online store, bamazon updates the stock quantity when an order is successfully placed.
